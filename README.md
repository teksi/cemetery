# TEKSI Cemetery

This is a simple QGIS based mode to handle and manage cemetery administrative data.

Supported classes in this first version are :

 - Units (plots, graves, columbarium, ...)
 - Deceased
 - Sectors

 - Contact people / societies

This is a very basic but efficient way of handling cemetery data outside Excel files and in a more visual way.

It enables :

 - Document creation through composers (not yet implemented)
 - Search engine through QGIS
 - Geoportal exports (not yet implemented)

It was originally designed as a proof of concept of an administrative GIS application based on QGIS/postgis for cemetery.
